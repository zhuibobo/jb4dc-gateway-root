Changes for REDIPS.table library

1.2.0 (2020-03-23)
- REDIPS.table is checked with ESLint - cleaning

1.1.0
- if table cell contains "ignore" class name then onmousedown event listener will not be attached to this table cell
- in case of inserting table row, REDIPS.table.row() method will return row reference (otherwise it will return NULL)
- added cell_ignore() method
- fixed cell_index() method (tr reference is table.rows instead of table.getElementsByTagName('TR') - simpler solution and immune to inner tables)
- added REDIPS.table.mark_nonempty public property (if set to false then not empty cells could not be marked)

1.0.4
- added control to disable deleting last row or last column in the table
- added minimized version redips-table-min.js

1.0.3
- if onmousedown is not attached to table cells then appended row shouldn't listen onmousedown event also

1.0.2
- added option to merge() method to leave or clear cells marked after merging (added boolean "clear" optional parameter)
